### Usage

1. Download the Asphyxia plugin of your choosing:
    a. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/22vv0/asphyxia_plugins/releases) page. Filter game plugins by using the "Find a release" search bar at the top (search for SDVX or DDR)
    b. Find the latest version release of the plugin for your specific game and version, indicated again by their codenames.
    c. Click the attached plugin archive if there is one or click "Source code (zip)" to start downloading.
2. Once downloaded, open and extract the files inside the zip to your specific game plugin folder, overwriting any files. 
    - If you're starting fresh, extract the files to a new folder named ddr@asphyxia or sdvx@asphyxia, depending on the plugin you've downloaded.
        - Do note that you can replace the "asphyxia" in the folder name with whatever alphabetic name you like. Make sure to rename the savedata db file the same name as well.
