## How to import data from non-core Asphyxia
To import data, you have to :

* Create a backup of your savedata.db file (in case something goes wrong).
* In the web UI of Asphyxia, go to POPN -> Profile and click detail on your profile
* Put the content of your non-core asphyxia popn music files in the text fields (pop.json and popn_scores.json) and click Import.
* Data is imported. Run the game, insert your card and your scores are available.

## Known limitations
* Tune Street : It will not report your profile name in-game
* Tune Street : No Town Mode
* No rival support implemented
* Some stats are not implemented (like daily stats, most played music)
