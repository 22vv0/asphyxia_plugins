### Usage

1. Download the Asphyxia plugin of your choosing via one of two methods:
    - Method 1:
        1. Select the branch of the game plugin you want to use. Branch names use the game's codenames:
            - kfc for SDVX
            - mdx for DDR
        2. Click the green "Code" button and then click "Download ZIP" to start downloading.
    - Method 2:
        1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/22vv0/asphyxia_plugins/releases) page.
        2. Find the latest version release of the plugin for your game, indicated again by their codenames.
        3. Click "Source code (zip)" to start downloading.
2. Once downloaded, open and extract the files inside the zip to your specific game plugin folder, overwriting any files. 
    - If you're starting fresh, extract the files to a new folder named ddr@asphyxia or sdvx@asphyxia, depending on the plugin you've downloaded.
