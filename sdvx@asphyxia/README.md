Message from repo fork:
- I highly recommend using the stable version of the plugin.
- This version is only properly usable in proper arcade data, meaning no mods.
- This is very work-in-progress. Please **BACK UP YOUR DATA** to prevent unwanted data loss (just in case)
- Please always remember to update datecode before using [WebUI Resource Update](/plugin/sdvx@asphyxia/WebUI%20resource%20update) feature (or this plugin in general).
- I won't update the text below lol
