Message from repo fork:

- This plugin update is for annoying people like me who doesn't want to use the unlock all feature lmao
- This fork enables a few of the features that are added in the later updates of Exceed Gear. However, I still highly recommend using the official stable version of the plugin. 
- Most importantly, run the [WebUI Resource Update](/plugin/sdvx@asphyxia/WebUI%20resource%20update) for everything to properly work.
- Don't expect stability, there might be some bugs. Please back up your data to prevent unwanted issues (just in case)
