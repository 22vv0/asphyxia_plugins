# SOUND VOLTEX

Plugin Version: **v6.0.0**

Message from repo fork:

- This fork enables a few of the features that are added in the later updates of Exceed Gear. However, I still highly recommend using the official stable version of the plugin. 
- Most importantly, run the [WebUI Asset Update](/plugin/sdvx@asphyxia/update%20webui%20assets) for everything to properly work.
- Don't expect stability, there might be some bugs. Please back up your data to prevent unwanted issues (just in case)

Supported Versions:

- BOOTH
- HEAVENLY HAVEN
- VIVIDWAVE
- EXCEED GEAR

Versions Not Supported:

- INFINITE INFECTION
- GRAVITY WARS

The plugin now mainly maintained versions:

- VIVIDWAVE
- EXCEED GEAR
