# Asphyxia CORE Community Plugins

These plugins are provided by community members and considered officially supported by Team Asphyxia.

## How to use it?

0. Make sure you have [Asphyxia CORE](https://asphyxia-core.github.io/) installed.
1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/asphyxia-core/plugins/releases) page.
2. Download the latest source code.
3. Extract the code in Asphyxia CORE's `plugins` folder.

## How do I contribute?

I don't actually follow any coding rules for this jank so neither should you. There is, however, a prettier configuration if you want to format the code automatically and forget about it.

I'll do my best to merge PR, but please make sure you are submitting code targeted for "public" releases. (Unless it is some ancient rare stuff and you feel generous enough to provide support for it)

- For new plugins: please use `@asphyxia` identifier for your plugin since you are submitting code as the community.
- For existing plugins: please inlude a changelog in your PR so it is easier for me to tell what it is for.

## How do I make plugins?

Checkout our [Documentation](https://asphyxia-core.github.io/typedoc/) and maybe consider join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/3TW3BDm) server. Make sure to familiar yourself with at least XML and Typescript/Javascript.

Note that you should run `npm install` to install typing for node and lodash, and launch CORE using `--dev` arguments to enable console log and typechecking when using typescript.
