About Forte Support
-------------------
Forte support is live. But since it has much difference compared to Op.2, Forte is not-primary-supported version.
It may works unexpectedly. Forte was tested very lightly. So this feature is tagged as **Experiment**.

Also, Technically, This *may* support First version of Nostalgia too.
But It's highly not recommend to run First version with it.
